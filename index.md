# Secure AI Autonomy Lab

Short Bio
======
<p style="font-size:12px; color: #494e52"> Dr. Paul Rad received his B.S. degree in computer engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, in 1994, the master’s degree in artificial intelligence from the Tehran Polytechnic, and the master’s degree in computer science, the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA. He is currently the Founder and the Director of the Secure AI and Autonomy Laboratory, Co-founder and Assistant Director of Open Cloud Institute, and an Associate Professor with the Departments of Information Systems and Cyber Security and Electrical and Computer Engineering (by courtesy) at UTSA.</p>

Research Interest
======
My research area is machine learning, an approach to Artificial Intelligence that relies on learning from data. I’m broadly interested in inference and causality using graphical and probabilistic deep models in applications such as computer vision, natural language understanding, and cyber analytics.
- AI security
- Knowledge representation
- Probabilistic decision making
- Reinforcement learning

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
